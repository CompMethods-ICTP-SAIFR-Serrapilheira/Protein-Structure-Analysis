This project aimed to investigate the structural features and extract evolutionary informations present in protein structures. The data were collected from the <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/">ðŸ”— PDB </a> database. 
The analyses were performed using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bio3d/index.html">ðŸ”— bio3D</a> and <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msa.html">ðŸ”— msa</a> packages.

The project folders are organized as follow. In the 'data/raw' are the data collected from the PDB database and in 'data/processed' the outputs. In 'docs' are present the bibliography.bib and the Project.html, and in 'R' the scripts.
